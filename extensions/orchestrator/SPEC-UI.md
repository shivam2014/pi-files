## 1. Three-Layer Hierarchy

Every orchestrator session produces a three-layer information hierarchy visible to the user.

```
Layer 1: Plan Panel       → Widget above editor — orchestrator's goal + delegation steps
                            (9-line budget, managed via setWidget)
Layer 2: Step Progress    → Inline in chat history — THIS IS THE MAIN FOCUS
                            Numbered steps with intent descriptions,
                            nested substeps (logical actions + findings),
                            tool call detail for the active tool
Layer 3: Peek Overlay     → Ctrl+Q — full subagent conversation viewer
                            (right-aligned overlay, 50% width, 80% max height)
```

### Layer 1 — Plan Panel (Widget)

- Location: `ctx.ui.setWidget("orchestrator-status", lines)` — sits above editor, outside chat scroll.
- Budget: **9 lines** max. Overflow trims oldest completed steps from top.
- Content: Mirror of the active delegation progress from Layer 2.
- The plan panel uses the **same rendering format** as the chat history blob.
- The plan panel is flat text (no box borders, no ANSI decoration).
- Cleared via `setWidget("orchestrator-status", undefined)` when orchestrator completes.

### Layer 2 — Step Progress (Chat History)

- Location: Inline in chat as a tool result text blob (rendered by `renderResult`).
- Content: Progress dots row + step rows with nested substeps.
- Each delegation produces one block in chat history.
- Streaming updates via `onUpdate` callback during delegation.

### Layer 3 — Peek Overlay (Ctrl+Q)

- Opened via `showPeek()` on Ctrl+Q.
- Right-aligned overlay, 50% width, 80% max height.
- Shows: goal, current step, recent substeps (last 3), streaming subagent text.
- Esc to close, double-press `x` within 600ms to abort subagent.
- Auto-scrolls, capped at 50 lines.
- Uses same icon format as Layer 2.

---

## 2. Status Icons

Every level of the hierarchy uses the same icon system:

| State     | Icon              | Notes                                   |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Completed | `✓`               | Checkmark — step/substep is done        |
| Active    | `⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏` | Moving spinner, cycles at 80ms          |
| Pending   | `○`               | Unfilled circle — not yet started       |

**Spinner specification:**
- 10 frames: `⠋ ⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠴ ⠦ ⠧ ⠇ ⠏`
- Cycle interval: **80ms**
- Frames cycle continuously while the item is active
- Spinner resets to frame 0 on step transitions
- After 10 frames (800ms), the cycle loops back to frame 0

---

## 3. Canonical Rendering Example

The following is the **exact rendering** that all implementations must produce:

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●○○ 1/3
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ✓ Grep "verifyToken" functions
    ✓ Read token validation logic
    ✓ Check middleware chain
    ✓ Report: Found expired token bug
    ✓ Report: Noted hardcoded secret issue
  ⠋ Step 2: Check token validation
    ⠋ Read src/auth/validate.ts
        ⠋ Running: cat src/auth/validate.ts
    ○ Check JWT decode flow
    ○ Find missing expiry check
    ○ Test with malformed token
    ○ Verify fix location
    ○ Add to fix list
  ○ Step 3: Find related tests
```

This rendering shows:
- **Line 1:** Goal line with `◆` prefix
- **Line 2:** Progress dots row (`●○○ 1/3`)
- **Line 3+:** Step rows at 2-space indent, substeps at 4-space indent
- **Step 1** is completed (checkmark + duration in parentheses)
- **Step 2** is active (spinner + no duration)
  - First substep is active (spinner)
  - Tool detail shown at 8-space indent under active substep
  - Remaining substeps are pending (unfilled circles)
- **Step 3** is pending (unfilled circle)

---

## 4. Progress Dots Row

**Format:** `●○○ N/M`

- One dot per step in the plan
- Dots are ordered left-to-right matching step order

| Dot State   | Symbol | Condition                              |
|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| Completed   | `●`    | Step is locked completed (checked)     |
| Active      | `●`/`○`| Blinks between filled and unfilled at 1s interval via `Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) % 2` |
| Errored    | `✗`    | Step encountered an error (substep shows error) |
| Not reached | `○`    | Step has not started yet               |

**N/M count:**
- `N` = number of **truly completed steps** (locked `●` dots only)
- `M` = total number of steps
- Example: `●○○ 1/3` means 1 of 3 steps completed
- Example: `●●○ 2/3` means 2 of 3 steps completed
- Example: `●●● 3/3` means all steps completed
- Example: `●✗○ 1/3` means 1 step completed, 1 step errored, 1 step pending

**Blink rule:** Active dot alternates `●`/`○` at **1s interval** via `Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) % 2`. Even seconds → `○`. Odd seconds → `●`. This is independent from the spinner animation.

---

## 5. Step Row Rendering

Each step is rendered at **2-space indent** from the left margin.

### Completed Step

```
  ✓ Step N: <label> (<duration>)
```

- `✓` — checkmark icon
- Space after icon
- `Step N:` — literal "Step" followed by the step number (1-indexed) and colon
- Space after colon
- `<label>` — intent description (e.g., "Read auth middleware")
- Space
- `(<duration>)` — formatted duration in parentheses

**Duration** is calculated from `startTime` to `endTime` using `formatDuration()`.
Format: `Xm Ys` if minutes > 0, or `Xs` if only seconds.
Examples: `(45s)`, `(2m 13s)`, `(1m 0s)`.

### Active Step

```
  <spinner> Step N: <label>
```

- Spinner icon (current frame of `⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏`)
- Space after spinner
- `Step N:` — same format as completed
- `<label>` — intent description
- **NO duration shown** on active steps

### Pending Step

```
  ○ Step N: <label>
```

- `○` — unfilled circle
- Space after icon
- `Step N: <label>` — same format
- No duration (not started)

### Error Step

```
  ✗ Step N: <label> (<duration>)
```

- `✗` — error icon
- Same label format as completed
- Duration optional (if step had started)

---

## 6. Substep Row Rendering

Substeps are rendered under their parent step at **4-space indent** from the left margin.

### Completed Substep

```
    ✓ <logical action>
    ✓ Report: <finding description>
```

- 4 spaces + `✓` + space + logical action text
- If the substep is a **finding** (information discovered during execution), use `Report:` prefix:
  `    ✓ Report: Found expired token bug`
- Duration is **NOT** shown for substeps (only steps show duration)

### Active Substep

Only ONE substep can be active at a time — the one currently executing.

```
    <spinner> <logical action>
```

- 4 spaces + spinner + space + logical action text
- Example: `    ⠋ Read src/auth/validate.ts`

### Pending Substep

```
    ○ <planned action>
```

- 4 spaces + `○` + space + planned action text
- Example: `    ○ Check JWT decode flow`

### Errored Substep

```
    ✗ <action>
```

- 4 spaces + `✗` + space + action text
- Shows the substep that was active when the error occurred
- Completed substeps before the error remain visible with `✓`
- Pending substeps after the errored one are not shown (they weren't reached)
- An error message may appear below the substeps as `⚠ <message>`

**Example — Step with error during execution:**

```
  ✗ Step 2: Check token validation (20s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/validate.ts
    ✓ Check JWT decode flow
    ✗ Find missing expiry check
    ⚠ File not found: src/auth/validate.ts
```

Note: The `✗` substep indicates exactly which action failed, while `⚠` provides the error details.

### No Substeps for Completed/Pending Steps

- **Completed steps** show ALL their completed substeps (see [Collapse Not Erase](#13-collapse-not-erase))
- **Pending steps** show no substeps (they haven't started)
- Only the **active step** can have a mix of completed, active, and pending substeps

---

## 7. Tool Detail Row (Ephemeral)

Tool detail is a **third-level** row shown only for the active substep. It displays the currently running tool command.

**Format:**

```
        <spinner> Running: <command summary>
```

- **8 spaces** from left margin + spinner + ` Running: ` + command summary
- Uses the same spinner animation as steps/substeps
- Command summary is a concise description of the tool being executed

**Ephemeral behavior:**
- **Appears** when a tool call starts (`tool_execution_start`)
- **Updates** in-place as the command runs (frame updates only — text stays same)
- **Disappears** when the tool call completes (`tool_execution_end`)
- When tool completes, the detail line is removed and the substep gets `✓` (if the subagent marks it done)

**Tool detail is NOT a substep.** It is a transient detail view of the active substep's current tool call. Multiple tool calls within one substep will each produce their own ephemeral detail line, one at a time.

**Only shown under the active substep.** If no substep is active, no tool detail row is shown.

---

## 8. Indentation Scheme

All indentation is from the **left margin** of the chat history text blob.

| Level | Content            | Indent | Example                                      |
|-------|--------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Goal line          | 0      | `◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug`         |
| 0     | Progress dots row  | 0      | `●○○ 1/3`                                    |
| 1     | Step               | 2      | `  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)`      |
| 2     | Substep            | 4      | `    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts`            |
| 3     | Tool detail        | 8      | `        ⠋ Running: cat src/auth/validate.ts`  |

**Edge case — finding substep in a completed step:**
```
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ✓ Report: Found expired token bug
```
The `Report:` prefix is part of the substep text, not an additional indent level.

---

## 9. Blink Logic

The active step's progress dot blinks to create visual distinction.

**Mechanism:**
- The dot alternates between `●` (filled) and `○` (unfilled)
- Alternation rate is **1 second** via `Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) % 2`
- On **even seconds**: active dot shows `○`
- On **odd seconds**: active dot shows `●`
- This is independent from the spinner animation (which runs at 80ms)
- 1s blink avoids visual noise — easy to see at a glance without being distracting

**Example progression over 3 seconds:**
```
t=0s:  ●○○ 1/3    (even second — active dot is ○)
t=1s:  ●●○ 1/3    (odd second — active dot is ●)
t=2s:  ●○○ 1/3    (even — ○)
```

The first step is already completed (locked `●`), the second step is active (blinking), the third is pending (locked `○`).

---

## 10. Duration Format

Duration is displayed **only for completed steps** (not substeps, not active steps).

**Format:** `formatDuration(deltaMs)`

| Elapsed | Display    |
|---------|------------|
| 0-59s   | `(Ns)`     |
| 1m+     | `(Xm Ys)`  |
| 0s      | `(0s)`     |

**Examples:**
- `(45s)` — 45 seconds
- `(2m 13s)` — 2 minutes 13 seconds
- `(1m 0s)` — exactly 1 minute
- `(0s)` — instantaneous

**Rules:**
- Active steps: **NO duration shown** (not even elapsed — the user doesn't see a ticking timer)
- Completed steps: duration shown in parentheses after the label
- Substeps: **NO duration shown** (only steps show duration)
- Error steps: duration shown if the step was active before error

---

## 11. Substep Parsing from Subagent Output

The subagent communicates its plan via structured text output. The orchestrator parses this text to produce the step/substep tree.

### Subagent Output Format

```
## Goal
Find the auth token validation bug and determine the fix

## Steps
Step 1: Read auth middleware
  - Read src/auth/middleware.ts
  - Grep "verifyToken" functions
Step 2: Check token validation
  - Read src/auth/validate.ts
  - Check JWT decode flow
  - Find missing expiry check
Step 3: Find related tests
```

### Parsing Rules

1. **`## Goal`** — The line immediately after the goal heading is the goal text. Used for the `◆ <goal>` line.
2. **`## Steps`** — Each `Step N:` line creates a step. The step number `N` and label (text after `Step N:`) are extracted.
3. **Indented `-` bullets** under a step become substeps of that step. The text after `- ` is the logical action description.
4. **`- Report:` prefix** in a bullet marks the substep as a finding (rendered as `✓ Report: <text>`).
5. **Tool calls** are automatically tracked by the runtime — they appear as tool detail rows (Level 3) under the active substep. They do NOT create new substeps.

### Real-Time Substep Addition

During execution, the subagent can add new substeps via tool calls. When a tool call starts, the runtime:
1. Records it as the active substep's current tool (shows tool detail)
2. When the tool completes, the detail disappears
3. The subagent's text output may produce additional `- bullet` lines that become new completed substeps

---

## 12. Agent Instructions

The subagent's system prompt must instruct it to produce output in the parseable format.

### Required System Prompt Additions

Add the following instructions to the subagent system prompt:

```
## Output Format Requirements

When given a task, you MUST structure your response with:

1. **## Goal** — A one-line goal description starting on the line after this heading.

2. **## Steps** — Numbered steps using the format `Step N: <intent description>`.
   Each step should describe WHAT you need to accomplish (the intent), NOT the specific commands.

   Good: Step 1: Read auth middleware
   Bad:  Step 1: cat src/auth/middleware.ts

3. Under each step, list substeps as indented `- bullet` items.
   These are the logical actions you'll take or checks you'll perform.

   Example:
   Step 2: Check token validation
     - Read src/auth/validate.ts
     - Check JWT decode flow
     - Find missing expiry check

4. When you discover important findings during execution, add them as:
   - Report: <finding description>
   
   These can be added mid-execution as you discover things.

5. Do NOT list tool commands as steps. Tool calls are tracked automatically.
   Only list the logical intent.

6. Complete the `## Steps` section BEFORE making any tool calls.
   The steps serve as your plan of action.
```

---

## 13. Collapse Not Erase

Completed elements remain visible. They do not disappear.

### Steps
- Completed steps remain in the list with all their completed substeps visible
- The step gets `✓` but substeps are NOT collapsed
- Example — after Step 1 and Step 2 complete:

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●●○ 2/3
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ✓ Grep "verifyToken" functions
    ✓ Report: Found expired token bug
  ✓ Step 2: Check token validation (30s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/validate.ts
    ✓ Check JWT decode flow
    ✓ Find missing expiry check
    ✓ Report: Missing expiry check in JWT decode path
  ⠋ Step 3: Find related tests
```

### Substeps
- Completed substeps remain visible under their parent step
- They are never removed, collapsed, or hidden
- Each completed substep shows `✓`

### Tool Detail (Exception)
- Tool detail is **ephemeral** — the only element that disappears
- Tool detail shows the currently running tool for the active substep
- When the tool completes, the detail line is removed
- This is the only transient element in the rendering

---

### Two-Tier Rule (Layer 1 vs Layer 2)

The collapse-not-erase principle applies differently across layers:

**Layer 2 (Chat History):** All completed steps and their substeps remain fully visible forever. No trimming. This is the durable record.

**Layer 1 (Plan Panel, 9-line budget):** When the panel exceeds the 9-line budget, oldest completed steps (with their substeps) are trimmed from the top. The goal line, progress dots row, and active step are always retained regardless of budget. Completed substeps under the active step are the first candidates for trimming if the active step itself still overflows.

The Layer 1 trimming is purely a budget constraint — it does not change the rule that completed elements are never erased from the history layer.

---

## 14. Visual State Examples

### Example 1: Initial State (Plan Declared, No Work Started)

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
○○○ 0/3
  ○ Step 1: Read auth middleware
  ○ Step 2: Check token validation
  ○ Step 3: Find related tests
```

### Example 2: First Step Active, No Completed Substeps Yet

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●○○ 0/3
  ⠋ Step 1: Read auth middleware
    ⠋ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
        ⠋ Running: cat src/auth/middleware.ts
  ○ Step 2: Check token validation
  ○ Step 3: Find related tests
```

Note: Progress dot shows `●○○ 0/3` — the first dot blinks between ○ and ● (active step) but N=0 because no steps have truly completed yet.

### Example 3: First Step Partially Complete, Tool Running

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●○○ 0/3
  ⠋ Step 1: Read auth middleware
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ✓ Grep "verifyToken" functions
    ⠋ Read token validation logic
        ⠋ Running: grep -r "verifyToken" --include="*.ts"
    ○ Check middleware chain
    ○ Report: Found expired token bug (pending)
  ○ Step 2: Check token validation
  ○ Step 3: Find related tests
```

Note: Progress dot `●○○ 0/3` — the first dot blinks between ○ and ● (active step), N=0 because no steps are locked complete yet.

### Example 4: Step 1 Complete, Step 2 Active

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●○○ 1/3
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ✓ Grep "verifyToken" functions
    ✓ Read token validation logic
    ✓ Check middleware chain
    ✓ Report: Found expired token bug
    ✓ Report: Noted hardcoded secret issue
  ⠋ Step 2: Check token validation
    ⠋ Read src/auth/validate.ts
        ⠋ Running: cat src/auth/validate.ts
    ○ Check JWT decode flow
    ○ Find missing expiry check
    ○ Test with malformed token
    ○ Verify fix location
    ○ Add to fix list
  ○ Step 3: Find related tests
```

Progress dots: `●○○ 1/3` — step 1 is locked completed (`●`), step 2 is active (blinks between ○ and ●), step 3 is pending (`○`).

### Example 5: Tool Call Completes, Detail Removed

When the `cat src/auth/validate.ts` tool finishes, the tool detail line disappears:

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●○○ 1/3
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ...
  ⠋ Step 2: Check token validation
    ✓ Read src/auth/validate.ts         ← now checked (tool detail gone)
    ⠋ Check JWT decode flow
        ⠋ Running: grep "decode" src/auth/validate.ts
    ○ Find missing expiry check
    ...
  ○ Step 3: Find related tests
```

Progress dots: `●○○ 1/3` — step 1 is locked completed (`●`), step 2 is active (blinks between ○ and ●), step 3 is pending (`○`).

### Example 6: Two Steps Complete, Third Active

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●●○ 2/3
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ✓ Grep "verifyToken" functions
    ✓ Read token validation logic
    ✓ Check middleware chain
    ✓ Report: Found expired token bug
    ✓ Report: Noted hardcoded secret issue
  ✓ Step 2: Check token validation (30s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/validate.ts
    ✓ Check JWT decode flow
    ✓ Find missing expiry check
    ✓ Test with malformed token
    ✓ Verify fix location
    ✓ Add to fix list
  ⠋ Step 3: Find related tests
    ⠋ Find existing tests for auth middleware
        ⠋ Running: grep -r "auth" src/__tests__/
    ○ Check test coverage for token validation
    ○ Identify missing test cases
```

Progress dots: `●●○ 2/3` — steps 1 and 2 are locked completed (`●`), step 3 is active (blinks between ○ and ●).

### Example 7: All Steps Complete

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●●● 3/3
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ✓ Grep "verifyToken" functions
    ✓ Read token validation logic
    ✓ Check middleware chain
    ✓ Report: Found expired token bug
    ✓ Report: Noted hardcoded secret issue
  ✓ Step 2: Check token validation (30s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/validate.ts
    ✓ Check JWT decode flow
    ✓ Find missing expiry check
    ✓ Test with malformed token
    ✓ Verify fix location
    ✓ Add to fix list
  ✓ Step 3: Find related tests (22s)
    ✓ Find existing tests for auth middleware
    ✓ Check test coverage for token validation
    ✓ Identify missing test cases
```

### Example 8: Step with Error

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●✗○ 1/3
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ✓ Grep "verifyToken" functions
    ...
  ✗ Step 2: Check token validation (20s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/validate.ts
    ✓ Check JWT decode flow
    ✗ Find missing expiry check
  ○ Step 3: Find related tests
```

Note: When a step errors, its substeps up to the error point remain visible.
The error icon `✗` replaces the spinner or checkmark at the step level.
Progress dots: `●✗○ 1/3` — step 1 is locked completed (`●`), step 2 is errored (`✗`), step 3 is pending (`○`).

### Example 9: Dynamic Step Addition

Orchestrator discovers a new step is needed mid-execution.

```
◆ Investigate codebase for auth bug
●○○○ 1/4
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
    ✓ Read src/auth/middleware.ts
    ✓ Report: Found JWT secret hardcoded in config
  ⠋ Step 2: Check token validation
    ⠋ Read src/auth/validate.ts
    ○ Check JWT decode flow
    ...
  ○ Step 3: Find related tests
  ○ Step 4: Fix hardcoded JWT secret (NEW)    ← dynamically added
```

Progress dots: `●○○○ 1/4` — step 1 is locked completed (`●`), step 2 is active (blinks between ○ and ●), steps 3 and 4 are pending (`○`). The N/M count updates to reflect the new total of 4 steps.

### Example 10: Plan Panel Widget (Layer 1)

The plan panel widget mirrors the same format but is budget-constrained to 9 lines.

```
◆ Fix auth bug
●○○ 1/3
  ✓ Step 1: Read auth middleware (45s)
  ⠋ Step 2: Check token validation
    ⠋ Read src/auth/validate.ts
        ⠋ Running: cat file
  ○ Step 3: Find related tests
```

Progress dots: `●○○ 1/3` — step 1 is locked completed (`●`), step 2 is active (blinks between ○ and ●), step 3 is pending (`○`).

If over 9 lines, trim oldest completed steps from top. The goal line, progress dots, and active step are always retained.

### Rendering Function

```
renderProgress(state: OrchestratorState): string[]
```

Returns a `string[]` where each element is one line of text. This array is used both for:
- `setWidget("orchestrator-status", lines)` — plan panel (Layer 1), truncated to 9 lines
- `onUpdate(lines.join('\n'))` — chat history blob (Layer 2), full rendering

### Formatting Helpers

| Helper | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `formatDuration(ms)` | `45s`, `2m 13s` |
| `spinnerFrame(index)` | Returns current spinner char from frame index |
| `progressDot(index, activeIdx, completedSet)` | Returns `●`, `○`, or blinking variant |
| `indent(level)` | Returns `' ' * (level * 2)` — level 1=2sp, level 2=4sp, level 3=8sp |

### Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Goal line starts with `◆`
- [ ] Progress dots: `●○○ N/M` format, active dot blinks at 80ms
- [ ] Completed steps: `  ✓ Step N: <label> (<duration>)`
- [ ] Active steps: `  <spinner> Step N: <label>` (no duration)
- [ ] Pending steps: `  ○ Step N: <label>`
- [ ] Completed substeps: `    ✓ <action>`
- [ ] Finding substeps: `    ✓ Report: <finding>`
- [ ] Active substeps: `    <spinner> <action>`
- [ ] Pending substeps: `    ○ <action>`
- [ ] Tool detail: `        <spinner> Running: <command>` under active substep only
- [ ] Tool detail is ephemeral — removed on tool completion
- [ ] Completed substeps stay visible (collapse not erase)
- [ ] Substep parsing: `Step N:` → steps, `- bullet` → substeps, `- Report:` → findings
- [ ] No duration shown on active steps or substeps
- [ ] Spinner: 10 frames, 80ms cycle
- [ ] Plan panel capped at 9 lines

## 16. Lint Tool Call (Auto-Lint)

After every `edit` or `write` tool call completes, a `lint` tool call
is automatically emitted to verify the edited file for errors.

### 16.1 Position in Feed

The lint tool call appears IMMEDIATELY after the edit/write result,
before the assistant's next response:

```
[tool: edit auth.ts]           → ✓ patch applied
[tool: lint auth.ts]           → ✓ [tsc] OK
[assistant]                    → "Now let me check the next file..."
```

### 16.2 Rendering States

#### Running State (lint in progress)

```
⠋ [tsc] checking auth.ts...
```

- Spinner animates at 80ms (same as step spinner)
- Shows the tool name in brackets
- Shows the file being checked

#### Success State

```
✓ [tsc] auth.ts: OK
```

- `✓` icon (green/success)
- Tool name in brackets: `[tsc]`, `[ruff]`, `[go vet]`, `[javac]`, `[ruby -c]`, `[node]`
- Filename
- `OK` suffix

#### Failure State (errors found)

```
✗ [tsc] auth.ts:
  Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string' at line 15
```

- `✗` icon (red/error)
- Tool name in brackets
- Filename with colon
- Error message on next line(s), indented with 2 spaces

#### Warning State (tool unavailable)

```
⚠ [esbuild] auth.ts: esbuild not installed
```

- `⚠` icon (yellow/warning)
- Tool name in brackets
- Descriptive message

### 16.3 Tool Name Mapping

| Tool | Display Name | When Used |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| tsc | `tsc` | TypeScript files (standalone or project) |
| node | `node` | JavaScript files (standalone) |
| node --check | `node` | JavaScript syntax check |
| ruff | `ruff` | Python files |
| go vet | `go vet` | Go files |
| cargo check | `cargo` | Rust files |
| javac | `javac` | Java files |
| ruby -c | `ruby` | Ruby files (standalone) |
| rubocop | `rubocop` | Ruby files (project) |

### 16.4 Integration with Subagent Activity Feed

When the auto-lint fires within a subagent session (inside a
delegation), the lint tool call appears as part of the subagent's
tool call sequence:

```
delegate Coder: Fix auth middleware
  ◆ Fix auth middleware                        ●●○ 2/3
  ✓ Step 1: Find auth files (12s)
  ✓ Step 2: Fix token expiry
      → read auth.ts ✓
      → edit auth.ts ✓
      → lint auth.ts ✓ ✓ [tsc] OK
  ⠇ Step 3: Verify fix
      → running tests
```

The lint call appears as a substep under the current step, right
after the edit that triggered it.

### 16.5 LLM Self-Correction

The lint result is visible to the LLM as a tool result. This enables
self-correction:

```
Turn 1:
  [tool: edit]  auth.ts → patch applied
  [tool: lint]  auth.ts → ✗ [tsc] Type 'number' not assignable
Turn 2:
  [assistant]   "Let me fix that type error..."
  [tool: edit]  auth.ts → patch applied (fixed)
  [tool: lint]  auth.ts → ✓ [tsc] OK
```

The LLM sees the lint failure, understands the error, and fixes it
in the next turn. This happens without user intervention.

### 16.6 Visual Examples

#### Example A: Successful Edit → Lint

```
[tool: edit auth.ts]
  ✓ Applied patch: changed return type
[tool: lint auth.ts]
  ✓ [tsc] auth.ts: OK
```

#### Example B: Edit with Syntax Error → Lint Failure → Self-Correction

```
[tool: edit auth.ts]
  ✓ Applied patch: added new function
[tool: lint auth.ts]
  ✗ [tsc] auth.ts:15:3 - error TS1005: ';' expected
[assistant]
  "I see the syntax error. Missing semicolon at line 15. Fixing..."
[tool: edit auth.ts]
  ✓ Applied patch: added missing semicolon
[tool: lint auth.ts]
  ✓ [tsc] auth.ts: OK
```

#### Example C: Python Edit

```
[tool: edit main.py]
  ✓ Applied patch: updated greeting function
[tool: lint main.py]
  ✓ [ruff] main.py: OK
```

#### Example D: Go Edit with Error

```
[tool: edit server.go]
  ✓ Applied patch: added new route
[tool: lint server.go]
  ✗ [go vet] server.go: unreachable code at line 42
[assistant]
  "The go vet check found unreachable code after return statement..."
```

### 16.7 Implementation Notes

- The lint tool call is auto-generated by lint-guard.ts, NOT by the LLM
- The tool name in the feed is `lint` (not the underlying linter name)
- The underlying tool name (tsc, ruff, go vet, etc.) appears in brackets
- The lint result is sent via `pi.sendMessage()` — it's a real message
  in the conversation that the LLM can see
- The lint check runs AFTER the edit/write tool result is committed,
  so the LLM sees both the edit result and the lint result together

## 17. Retry State

When a errored step is retried, the rendering transitions through three states.

### 17.1 Retry Indicator

During a retry, a single-line indicator replaces the full step tree:

```
⠇ Retry 2/3: File not found: src/auth/validate.ts
```

- `⠇` spinner (uses same 10-frame, 80ms cycle as step spinner)
- `Retry N/M:` — N = current retry attempt (1-indexed), M = max retries
- `:` space + reason for the retry (the error message that triggered it)

### 17.2 Retry Appearance

The retry indicator appears when:
1. A step errors (shows ✗ at step level)
2. The orchestrator decides to retry instead of failing
3. The step tree is temporarily replaced by the retry indicator

### 17.3 Retry Success

If the retry succeeds, normal rendering resumes. The step shows as active (spinner) with its substeps, as if the error never happened:

```
  ⠋ Step 2: Check token validation
    ✓ Read src/auth/validate.ts
    ⠋ Check JWT decode flow
```

The previous error and retry indicator are replaced — they do not remain in the feed.

### 17.4 Retry Exhaustion

If all N/M retries fail, the step returns to error state (✗ with error message). The retry count is shown in the indicator.

### 17.5 Rendering Priority

The retry indicator takes priority over all other rendering — when retry is active, the entire feed renders as the single retry line. This ensures the user sees the retry status immediately.

Implementation: In `renderActivityFeed`, the `state.errored` block checks for `retryCount` first and returns early with the retry indicator line.
